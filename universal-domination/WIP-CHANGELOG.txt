- Refactored entire project
- Fixed a bug that caused generators to always buy 10 when above 10 purchases
- Fixed a bug that caused generator costs to display as zero when you can't afford them
- Quarks are now appropriately called Quarks on their display
- Combustors are now called Accelerators
- Accelerators now provide a flat (×1.100) multiplier to all generators
- Fixed a bug that allowed you to phase shift multiple times at once
- Fixed the above bug again because apparently it wasn't actually fixed
- Fixed a bug that caused you to NaN when buying max right as you hit cost scaling (thanks escapee!)
- Added Big Rip, Manifold Generators, Manifold Challenges, Strange and Charmed Matter, and Achievements
- Reworked the layout of the game

- Endgame is reaching 1.8e308 Manifolds (Supernova Requirement)
(Stellar Remnant formula will be 5^(log10(x)/308). It should be difficult to get more than e600 Manifolds.)

KNOWN ISSUES:
Atoms reset to zero in Respecialized Advancements if you attempt to purchase more than 4. This is due to the buy max
code for Atoms, which doesn't account for the edge case of being in this challenge. I do not know if it actually
makes the challenge impossible.

a0.11 - Emergency Bug Squash and Balance Hotfix
- Fixed a bug that allowed you to continue purchasing Interval upgrades even when the Phase Shift prompt was visible.
- Fixed a bug that caused Manifold Generators to be stuck at a ×0 multiplier
- Added rewards for Achievements 11-18
- The base Atom multiplier is now ×5
- Manifold Upgrade 23 buffed from ×10 → ×20

a0.20 - Stuff the update
- Updated visuals for pretty much the whole game
- Fixed a bug that caused the Atom multiplier to not apply to the 4th Generator (MC1x1 should be possible now!)
- Added some more Achievements, gave functionality to some of them
- Fixed a bug with Residual Annihilation's reward that caused its effect to actually be ^2.05
- Made Residual Annihilation's effect affect QG Multipliers instead of Intensity to compensate
- Buffed the formula for Destructive Returns to compensate
- Added a Max All button for Manifold Generators
- Touched up the Perfect Matter formula
- Added a Statistics tab
- Implemented the Options tab

Additions that will not be included on release:
- Added Supernova reset layer (5^x/308)
- Added Space Generators, which increase your Buy 10 Multiplier
