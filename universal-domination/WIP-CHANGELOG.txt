- Refactored entire project
- Fixed a bug that caused generators to always buy 10 when above 10 purchases
- Fixed a bug that caused generator costs to display as zero when you can't afford them
- Quarks are now appropriately called Quarks on their display
- Combustors are now called Accelerators
- Accelerators now provide a flat (×1.100) multiplier to all generators
- Fixed a bug that allowed you to phase shift multiple times at once
- Fixed the above bug again because apparently it wasn't actually fixed
- Fixed a bug that caused you to NaN when buying max right as you hit cost scaling (thanks escapee!)
- Added Big Rip, Manifold Generators, Manifold Challenges, Strange and Charmed Matter, and Achievements
- Reworked the layout of the game

- Endgame is reaching 1.8e308 Manifolds (Supernova Requirement)
(Stellar Remnant formula will be 5^(log10(x)/308). It should be difficult to get more than e600 Manifolds.)

KNOWN ISSUES:
Atoms reset to zero in Respecialized Advancements if you attempt to purchase more than 4. This is due to the buy max
code for Atoms, which doesn't account for the edge case of being in this challenge. I do not know if it actually
makes the challenge impossible.
Residual Annihilation actually raises Intensities ^2.05 instead of 1.05, and somehow the game is balanced despite that.
CBA to deal with this right now - My thought is I can buff its intended effect slightly and then buff Destructive Returns's effect

a0.11 - Emergency Bug Squash and Balance Hotfix
- Fixed a bug that allowed you to continue purchasing Interval upgrades even when the Phase Shift prompt was visible.
- Fixed a bug that caused Manifold Generators to be stuck at a ×0 multiplier
- Added rewards for Achievements 11-18
- The base Atom multiplier is now ×5
- Manifold Upgrade 23 buffed from ×10 → ×20
